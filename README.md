# vector_graph
### Vector Index Creation:

- Creates a vector index named 'chunk_embeddings' in Neo4j
- Uses cosine similarity metric for vector comparisons
- Dimension is set to 1536 for OpenAI embeddings


### Improved Similarity Search:

- Replaces manual dot product calculations with Neo4j's native vector search
- Uses the vector index for faster and more efficient similarity calculations
- Returns properly formatted results matching your existing structure


### Optimized Document Processing:

- Adds batch processing for embeddings to manage memory better
- Ensures embeddings are stored in the correct format for the vector index
- Maintains compatibility with your existing code structure

### Improved Batch Processing
```python
# Instead of processing one chunk at a time:
for idx, chunk_text in enumerate(chunks):
    embedding = self.embeddings.embed_query(chunk_text)  # One API call per chunk

# We could batch process:
batch_size = 10
for i in range(0, len(chunks), batch_size):
    batch = chunks[i:i + batch_size]
    embeddings = self.embeddings.embed_documents(batch)  # One API call for multiple chunks
```
